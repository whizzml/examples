It then creates a new dataset, with additional fields containing ordinal encodings of the categorical fields.\n\nIf classes have a known order (such as Like, Somewhat Like, Neutral, Somewhat Dislike, and Dislike), the integer mapping can be supplied; otherwise, integers are assigned by class count, in descending order (in the case of ties, classes are ordered alphabetically).\n\nFor more information, please see the [readme](https://github.com/whizzml/examples/tree/master/ordinal-encoder).",
